	Terms:
Expression - The logical expression entered into the text field.
Variable - Any single character is a variable. 
Constant - True or false. May also be represented as 1 or 0.
Operator - AND, OR, NOT, IMPLY, IFF
Batch mode - The expression is not evaluated until the "GO" button is pressed.
Dynamic mode - The expression is evaluated each time it changes.
Full mode - The expression is displayed variables first, and then each step in the correct order of operations.
Compact mode - The expression is displayed all together with the results of each variable or operation displayed under itself. (aka Half-as-Fast)

	Rules:
All expressions must follow the following rules to evaluated.
1. All expressions must contain at least one variable, or at least one constant and one valid operator.
2. All operators must be valid
3. To be valid all NOT operators must preceed another not, a variable, a constant, or a parenthetical expression.
4. To be valid all AND, OR, IMPLIES, and IFF operators must follow a variable, a constant, or a valid parenthetical expression.
5. To be valid all AND, OR, IMPLIES, and IFF operators must be followed by a NOT, a variable, a constant, or a valid parenthetical expression.
6. All opening parentheses must hava a coresponding closing parenthesis.

	Hints:
1. This program is case INSENSITIVE. a == A, tRuE = TRUE = true, and OR = or.
2. AND may be represented by /\ or * or " and " with the spaces and without quotes.
3. OR may be represented by \/ or + or " or " with the spaces and without quotes.
4. NOT may be represented by ! or ~ or " not " with the spaces and without quotes.
5. IMPLIES may be represented by --> or > or " implies " or " imply " with the spaces and without quotes.
6. IFF may be represented by <-> or < or " iff " with the spaces and without quotes.
7. TRUE may be represented by 1 or " true " with the spaces and without quotes.
8. FALSE may be represented by 0 or " false " with the spaces and without quotes.
